Note here all places in the code where you compromised of "right" coding.

1. constants: Use another data structure for Tasks and Contrasts
2. constants: Organize
3. PredictController: consider implement it without a class (just pass the relevant properties from hand to hand)
4. Move constants.py to Shared_Utils and handle the importing
5. Implement Tasks selection with TreeView instead of TreeWidget
6. Find another place for Subject class instead of PredictModel.py
