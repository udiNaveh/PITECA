Reqeusts for keren:

1. modify the exception handling mechanism to allow showing whole error stack in debugging
2. when predict session is done, add a button in the dialog box to open the output directory
3. default directory for browsing - should be the last directory used (as long as PITECA is open)
4. files with same name - should have a solution - if prediction path already exists - we should handle it (ask the user whether to use old file, override or keep both with different names,
simpler solution would be to always keep both but to enumerate filenames - as happens in windows downloads directory). This should be done in the check prior to the predictions themselves.
5. available tasks in predict tab - should be according to the available tasks in the model


------------
- choose model in settings - look at roee's solution
- open in wb_view
- add option to use pre-loaded all features matrix
- cache for analysis
- replace svd in feature extraction
- correlation with predicted matrix : add normalized version
